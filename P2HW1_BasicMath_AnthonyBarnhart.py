# Adding the first number and the second number.
sum = number_bob + number_jim

# Multiplying the two numbers together.
product = number_bob * number_jim

# Display the results.

#Pseudocode for the above program

# Ask user to input 1st number
# Ask user to input 2nd number
# Calculate the sum of the given numbers
# Calculate the product of the given numbers
# Display the two numbers input, the sum, and product of them
